Machino
=======

A tool that supports creating and testing Arduino programs with the use of a state machines. It allows drawing a state transition diagram for which a code outline is automatically maintained next to it, allowing the code for the conditions and actions to be filled in. When running the program on an Arduino, it will show the operation of the state machine in the diagram.
